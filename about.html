        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-me m-t">
            My name is Nikolay Arhipov and I am a software engineer from Latvia.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about programming.
            I find it important to not simply develop and ship a product
            which meets clients requirements, but to make something that
            exceed. I believe that the result of my job should be something
            that improves users experience from any perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since I am a technical person, it would be unnatural not to mention
            the enthusiasm, with which I always look forward towards learning new
            technologies, approaches and methods that could influence, inspire and
            potentially improve the result of my work. At the same time I find it even
            more important to understand how the things that I am used to work.
            Since there is no such thing as dated algorithms, data structures, or even
            mathematical models, in my opinion there is no reason jumping on trending technologies,
            if you did not thoroughly study the existing solutions for the problem
            that you already use or might have used.
